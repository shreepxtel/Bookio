## BOOKIO
<b>Description</b>: Bookio is a library booking system used to book specific rooms and computers according to the time the user would like to access it. Bookio is all about improving efficiency for the students in ways that students come prepared to the library depending on if they have booked a room or a computer.

<b>Installation</b>: Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

<b>Usage</b>: The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

</b>Contributing</b>: Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for setting guidelines for repository contributors.
